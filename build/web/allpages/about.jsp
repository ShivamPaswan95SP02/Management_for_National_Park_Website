             <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The Post-Independence era witnessed tremendous encroachment towards the Dudhwa jungle.
                As a result the forest was converted in an agricultural land. Additionally,
                due to its location on the Indo-Nepal border the chances of poaching and hunting 
                enhanced to greater extent and the trading of the wild animals increased to
                a massive extent who sell their products in Nepal, which being a tourist place
                gives them a huge market for these things.

It was the perfect money-making place for the poachers but it was "Billy" Arjan Singh whose
single handed efforts made this park to reach at its richness. The great conservationist
initiated an idea of converting this land into a wildlife sanctuary in the year 1965 and 
thus received a lot of appraisal from the wildlife conservationists and wildlife lovers across the world.

In 1977, Arjan Singh approached the erstwhile prime minister, Indira Gandhi to declare the forest 
as a National park. In 1984-85, seven rhinos were relocated from Assam and Nepal to Dudhwa to 
rehabilitate a rhino population which lived here 150 years ago. Four years later, 
it was declared a Tiger Reserve under the Project Tiger and currently is a major habitat for 
tigers in India.
